# How Do Drivers Allocate Their Potential Attention?



## Eye tracking dataset
The eye tracking dataset is released [link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zyxvEQiMkmOkxmyDlDv0xA);     Password: i5q7

The folder includes: fixdata, traffic videos, traffic frames.You need to extract each frame from videos and put it in traffic frames folder.


## CDNN requirements
* Pytorch 0.4.1

* Python 2.7
